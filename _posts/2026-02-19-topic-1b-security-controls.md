# Topic 1B: Security Controls

---

# Security Control Categories

## Summary
Security controls ensure that systems and data assets maintain confidentiality, integrity, availability, and non-repudiation. These controls are categorized into managerial, operational, technical, and physical, each addressing different aspects of security implementation.

---

## Detailed Explanation

### Security Controls
- Purpose: Provide systems and data assets with confidentiality, integrity, availability, and non-repudiation.  
- Categories:
  - Managerial: Oversight and evaluation.  
  - Operational: Implemented by people.  
  - Technical: Implemented as systems.  
  - Physical: Deter and detect physical access.

## Category Overview Table

| Category     | Definition                              | Implementation Type      | Examples |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------|
| Managerial   | Provide oversight of the information system | Policies & evaluation     | Risk identification, evaluation tools |
| Operational  | Implemented primarily by people          | Human-driven controls     | Security guards, training programs |
| Technical    | Implemented as hardware, software, or firmware | System-based controls | Firewalls, antivirus software, OS access control models |
| Physical     | Deter and detect access to premises and hardware | Environmental safeguards | Security cameras, alarms, gateways, locks, lighting, security guards |

# Security Control Functional Types

## Summary
Security controls can be defined by their function: preventive, detective, corrective, directive, deterrent, and compensating. Each type serves a specific role in protecting information systems and data assets.

---

## Functional Types Table

| Control Type   | Definition | Operation Timing | Examples |
|----------------|------------|------------------|----------|
| Preventive     | Eliminate or reduce the likelihood of an attack succeeding | Before an attack | Access Control Lists (ACLs), Antimalware Software |
| Detective      | Identify and record attempted or successful intrusions | During an attack | Logs |
| Corrective     | Eliminate or reduce the impact of a security policy violation | After an attack | Backup Systems, Patch Management Systems |
| Directive      | Enforce rules of behavior, policies, and procedures | Ongoing | Employee Contracts, Training Programs |
| Deterrent      | Psychologically discourage attackers | Before attempt | Signs and Warnings |
| Compensating   | Substitute for principal controls, providing equivalent or better protection | Alternative measure | Alternative Technologies |

---

## Detailed Explanation

### Preventive Controls
- Definition: Eliminate or reduce the likelihood of an attack succeeding.  
- Operation: Before an attack.  
- Examples:
  - Access Control Lists (ACLs): Configured on firewalls and file systems.  
  - Antimalware Software: Blocks malicious processes.

### Detective Controls
- Definition: Identify and record attempted or successful intrusions.  
- Operation: During an attack.  
- Examples:
  - Logs: Record events and activities.

### Corrective Controls
- Definition: Eliminate or reduce the impact of a security policy violation.  
- Operation: After an attack.  
- Examples:
  - Backup Systems: Restore damaged data.  
  - Patch Management Systems: Fix vulnerabilities.

### Directive Controls
- Definition: Enforce rules of behavior, policies, and procedures.  
- Examples:
  - Employee Contracts: Set disciplinary procedures.  
  - Training Programs: Raise awareness and enforce policies.

### Deterrent Controls
- Definition: Psychologically discourage attackers.  
- Examples:
  - Signs and Warnings: Legal penalties for trespass or intrusion.

### Compensating Controls
- Definition: Substitute for principal controls, providing equivalent or better protection.  
- Examples:
  - Alternative Technologies: Different methods to achieve security.

---

## Key Points

- Preventive Controls: Prevent attacks (ACLs, antimalware software).  
- Detective Controls: Detect and record intrusions (Logs).  
- Corrective Controls: Mitigate impact post-attack (Backup systems, patch management).  
- Directive Controls: Enforce behavior and policies (Employee contracts, training programs).  
- Deterrent Controls: Discourage attacks (Legal warnings).  
- Compensating Controls: Substitute for primary controls (Alternative security technologies).

# Information Security Roles and Responsibilities

## Summary
A security policy defines how an organization will protect the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of its data and resources. Effective implementation varies by organization type but aims to ensure a strong security posture. Responsibilities are distributed across various roles, from executives to nontechnical staff.

---

## Detailed Explanation

### Security Policy
- Definition: Formal statement outlining security implementation.  
- Purpose: Protects data confidentiality, availability, and integrity.

### Implementation Variations
- Different Organizations: Schools, firms, manufacturers have unique implementations.  
- Common Goal: Secure employees, equipment, and data.

### Organizational Security Posture
- Framework-Based Controls: Use of best practices and security frameworks.  
- Employee Awareness: Understanding roles and responsibilities.

## Roles and Responsibilities Table

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| Chief Information Officer (CIO) | Overall IT function, possibly security |
| Chief Technology Officer (CTO) | Effective use of IT products and solutions |
| Chief Security Officer (CSO) / Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) | Dedicated security department |
| Managers | Specific domains like building control, web services |
| Technical and Specialist Staff | Implementing, maintaining, monitoring security policies (e.g., Information Systems Security Officer - ISSO) |
| Nontechnical Staff | Complying with policies and legislation |
| Directors/Owners | External security due care or liability |
